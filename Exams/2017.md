## Part 2


1. **Consider the following HTML code:**
```
<div class =" widget ">
    <ul id =" todo ">
        <li >Buy Bread </ li >
        <li >Learn Guitar </ li >
        <li class =" important ">Pay Bills </ li >
        <li class =" postponed ">Wash Car </ li >
    </ul>
</div>

li:first - child { color: blue } /* R1 */
div li { color: red } /* R2 */
div . widget ul#todo { color: cyan } /* R3 */
div > ul# todo . important { color: green } /* R4 */
ul li. postponed { color: inherit } /* R5 */
li + li + li { color: magenta } /* R6 */
```
*   **Calculate the specificity of each one of the rules (e.g. 0,2,2,1):**

| R1 | R2 | R3 | R4 | R5 | R6 |
| :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| 0, 0, 1, 1 | 0, 0, 0, 2 | 0, 1, 1, 2 | 0, 1, 1, 2 | 0, 0, 1, 2 | 0, 0, 0, 3 |


* **Taking into consideration only the rules R1 to R3, indicate the color of each of the texts in the page:**

| Buy Bread | Learn Guitar | Pay Bills | Wash Car |
| :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| Blue | Red | Red | Red |


* **Taking into consideration all the rules, indicate the color of each of the texts in the page:**

| Buy Bread | Learn Guitar | Pay Bills | Wash Car |
| :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| Blue | Red | Green | Cyan |


2. **Consider the following string:**
```
Washing the washing machine while watching the washing machine washing washing
```
**For each one of the regular expressions shown below, underline the first match:**

* **/wa.*ing/**

Washing the [washing machine while watching the washing machine washing washing]


* **/[a-z]{3}\b/**

Wash[ing] the washing machine while watching the washing machine washing washing


* **/(ing).*?\1/**

Wash[ing the washing] machine while watching the washing machine washing washing


* **/^.{3}/**

[Was]hing the washing machine while watching the washing machine washing washing



* **/(sh|ch)(?!ing)/**

Washing the washing ma[ch]ine while watching the washing machine washing washing


* **/(.+?).*?\1/**

W[ashing the wa]shing machine while watching the washing machine washing washing

< div id =" products ">
    <ul >
    <li >Apple: < span class ="qty">3 </ span > <a href ="#">+ </ a ></ li >
    <li >Banana: < span class =" qty ">5 </ span > <a href ="#">+ </a ></ li >
    <li >Pear: < span class =" qty ">6 </ span > <a href ="#">+ </a > </ li >
    </ ul >
    <a href ="#" class ="buy">Buy </a >
    <p class =" total ">0 </ a >
</ div >

```

* **When the link at the end of each list item is clicked, the quantity of that item is incremented by one.**
```
let products = document.getElementById('products)
let productsList = products.querySelector('ul')
let items = productsList.querySelectorAll('li')


items.forEach(item => {
    let link = item.querySelector('a')
    let quantity = item.querySelector('span.qty')
    link.addEventListener('click', funcion(){
        e.preventDefault()
        quantity.innerText = parseInt(quantity.innerText) + 1
    })
})

```


* **When the link having a class buy is clicked, an array called products, containing a list of all products and their quantities, should be sent in an Ajax POST request to the address calculatetotal.php.**

**When the result of that request is received, the text of the paragraph total should be replaced by the received result (or by not enough stock if the received result is less than 0).
Example of the array to be sent:**
[{"name":"Apple","qty":3},{"name":"Banana","qty":5},{"name":"Pear","qty":6}]

```
let buy = products.querySelector('.buy')
buy.addEventListener('click', function(e){
    e.preventDefault()
    let array = getProducts()

    let request = new XMLHttpRequest()
    request.open('POST', 'calculatetotal.php', true)
    request.onload = getResponse
    request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded')
    request.send(encodeForAjax(array))
})


function getProducts(){
    let products = []
    items.forEach(item=>{
        let name = item.innerText.split(':')[0]
        let quantity = parseInt(item.querySelector('.qty').innerText)
        products.push({name:name, qty:quantity})
    })
}

function getResponse(){
    let total = products.querySelector('.total')
    let newTotal = JSON.parse(this.responseText)

    if(newTotal < 0){
        total.innerText = 'not enough stock'
    }
    else 
        total.innerText = newTotal

}
