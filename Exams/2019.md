Consider the following HTML code representing a tic-tac-toe game played between a human
(browser) and a computer (server):
```
<section id="tic-tac-toe" data-id="1234">
<div class="square"></div>
<div class="square"></div>
<div class="square"></div>
<div class="square">X</div>
<div class="square">X</div>
<div class="square">O</div> 
<div class="square"></div>
<div class="square"></div>
<div class="square">O</div>
<p id="state">playing</p>

is always the first to play.
