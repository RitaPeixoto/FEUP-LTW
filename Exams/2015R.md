## Part 2 

1. **Consider the following HTML code:**
```
<div id ="selection">
    <p><a href ="">Two Lists </a></p>
    <ul>
        <li class ="selected ">First </li>
        <li>Second </li>
    </ul>
    <ol class ="other ">
        <li>Third </li>
    </ol>
</div>


.selected { color: blue ;} /* R1 */
li + li { color: green ;} /* R2 */
#selection .other li { color: yellow ;} /* R3 */

ul:first-child { color: magenta ;} /* R4 */
#selection p { color: red ;} /* R5 */
#selection li:first-child { color: cyan ;} /* R6 */
```

a) **Calculate the specificity of each one of the rules:**

| R1 | R2 | R3 | R4 | R5 | R6 |
| :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| 0 0 1 0 | 0 0 0 2 | 0 1 1 1 | 0 0 1 1 | 0 0 1 1 | 0 0 2 1 |

b) **Taking into consideration only the rules R1 to R3, indicate the color of each one of the texts in the page:**

| Two Lists | 1st First | 2nd Second | Third |
| :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| Blue | Blue | Green | Yellow |

c) **Taking into consideration all the rules, indicate the color of each one of the texts in the page:**

| Two Lists | 1st First | 2nd Second | Third |
| :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| Blue | Cyan | Green | Cyan |



2. **Consider the following string: 
```
The thirty-three thieves thought that they thrilled the throne throughout Thursday.
```
**For each one of the regular expressions shown below, underline the first match:**

a) **/led.+ro/**

The thirty-three thieves thought that they thril[led the throne thro]ughout Thursday.

b) **/[thir]+[^e]/**

The [thirty]-three thieves thought that they thrilled the throne throughout Thursday.

c) **/(\w{3}.+\1)/**

[The thirty-three thieves thought that they thrilled the throne throughout Thursday.]

d) **/ll.*e\b/**

The thirty-three thieves thought that they thri[lled the throne] throughout Thursday.

e) **/(h|r|t){3}/**

The thirty-[th]ree thieves thought that they thrilled the throne throughout Thursday.

f) **/(?<!h)o(?=u)/**

The thirty-three thieves thought that they thrilled the throne thr[o]ughout Thursday.


3. **Consider the following HTML code excerpt:**
```
1 < script >
2 var secret = Math . floor (( Math . random () * 100) + 1) ; // generates random number
3 var tries = 0;
4 </ script >
5 < input name =" username " type =" text " placeholder =" username ">
6 < input name =" guess " type =" text ">
7 < input id =" guess " type =" button " value =" Guess ">
```

a) **When the guess button is pressed, if the value in the input named guess is lower than the variable secret, a dialog with the sentence ”go up”should be shown, if it is higher, the sentence should read ”go down”and if they are the same, a function named correct should be called. The tries variable should be increased by one in any of the cases.**
```

```


b) **Create the function named correct, that was mentioned in the previous question, so that it shows a dialog with the sentence ”correct”and also makes an Ajax call to a save score.php script. The username (input with name username) and the number of tries (variable tries) should also be sent to that script. Inform the user if the script was called successfully or not.**
```

```

4. **Create a well-formed and valid XML document according to the following XSD:**
```
1 <? xml version =" 1.1 "? >
2 < xs:schema xmlns:xs =" http: // www .w3.org /2001/ XMLSchema ">
3 < xs:element name =" student ">
4 < xs:complexType >
5 < xs:choice >
6 < xs:element name =" name " type =" xs:string "/ >
7 < xs:element name =" nickname " type =" xs:string "/ >
8 </ xs:choice >
9 < xs:attribute name =" code " type =" scode "/ >
10 </ xs:complexType >
11 </ xs:element >
12 < xs:element name =" students ">
13 < xs:complexType >
14 < xs:sequence >
15 < xs:element ref =" student " minOccurs ="2" maxOccurs =" unbounded "/ >
16 </ xs:sequence >
17 < xs:attribute name =" count " type =" xs:integer "/ >
18 </ xs:complexType >
19 </ xs:element >
20 < xs:simpleType name =" scode ">
21 < xs:restriction base =" xs:string ">
22 < xs:pattern value ="\d {5}[A-Z ]{2} "/ >
23 </ xs:restriction >
24 </ xs:simpleType >
25 </ xs:schema >
```
