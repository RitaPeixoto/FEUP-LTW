``` 
< div class =" post " id =" first ">
    < div class =" header ">
        <h1 >Title </ h1 >
    </ div >
    <p >First paragraph </ p >
    <p >Second paragraph </p >
    < div class =" footer ">
        <p >This is a footer </ p >

</ div >

#first div { color: blue ;} /* R1 */
div . header { color: magenta ;} /* R2 */
p + p + div :first - child { color: red ;} /* R3 */
h1 { color: green ;} /* R4 */
div + p { color: cyan ;} /* R5 */
p { color: yellow ;} /* R6 */

```

* **Calculate the specificity of each one of the rules:**

| R1 | R2 | R3 | R4 | R5 | R6 |
| :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| 0, 1, 0, 1 | 0, 0, 1, 1 | 0, 0, 1, 3 | 0, 0, 0, 1 | 0, 0, 0, 2 | 0, 0, 0, 1 |


* **Taking into consideration only the rules R1 to R3, indicate the color of each one of the texts in the page:**

| Title | 1st Par | 2nd Par | Footer |
| :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| Blue | Black | Black | Red |


* **Taking into consideration all the rules, indicate the color of each one of the texts in the page:**


| Title | 1st Par | 2nd Par | Footer |
| :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| Green   | Cyan | Yellow | Red |


2. **Consider the following string: "When you write copy you have the right to copyright the copy you write"
For each one of the regular expressions shown below, underline the first match:**

* **/copy.\*right/**

When you write [copy you have the right to copyright the copy] you write


* **/[write]/**

Wh[en] you write copy you have the right to copyright the copy you write


* **/(\w{4}).*\1/**

When you [write copy you have the right to copyright the copy you writ]e

* **/write$/**

When you write copy you have the right to copyright the copy you [write]

* **/(ri|py)(?!t)/**

When you write co[py] you have the right to copyright the copy you write

* **/(\w{3,}?).*?\1/**

When [you write copy you] have the right to copyright the copy you write

```
< form id =" register " action =" register . php " method =" post ">
2 < input name =" username " type =" text ">
3 < input name =" password " type =" password ">
4 < input type =" submit " value =" Register ">
5 </ form >

```
a) **When the password input loses focus, it is verified if it contains at least 8 characters with at least one of them being a symbol other than a letter, a number or an underscore. If that’s not the case, the input’s border should become red.**

```

b) **When the submit button is clicked, the value of the username input should be sent, inside a variable named username, in an Ajax POST request to the address verifyusername.php. If the response indicates that the username is not valid, the border of the input should become red and the form should not be submitted. Consider that the result, in JSON format, can be either {"valid": "true"} or {"valid": "false"}.**

```
let form = document.querySelector('form #register')
let submit = form.querySelector('input[type="submit"]')
let username = form.querySelector('input[name="username"]')

submit.addEventListener('click', function(e){
    e.preventDefault()
    let request = new XMLHttpRequest()
    request.open('POST', 'verifyusername.php')
    request.onload = getResponse
    request.setRequestHeader('Conten-type', 'application/xx-www-urlencoded)
    request.send(encodeForAjax({username:username}))
})


function getResponse(e){
    e.preventDefault()
    let response = JSON.parse(this.responseText)

    if(response.value == "false"){
        username.style.border-color = "red" //assuming there is a border because they say become
    }
    else
        form.submit()
}
```




4. **Create a well-formed and valid XML document according to the following XSD:**

```

< xs:complexType name =" productType ">
< xs:sequence >

< xs:sequence >
< xs:element name =" product " type =" productType " maxOccurs =" unbounded " minOccurs ="3"/ >
< xs:element name =" wrap " type =" xs:integer " maxOccurs =" unbounded " minOccurs ="2"/ >
</ xs:sequence >
< xs:attribute name =" number " type =" xs:integer "/ >
</ xs:complexType >
< xs:element name =" order " type =" orderType ">
< xs:key name =" productKey ">
